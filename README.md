# PassGen5327

## Introduction
This project is a Python script that aims to create a limited number of combinations. 

## File Structure
- `MainCode.py`: Python script for generating passwords.
- `data.txt`: A text file containing the data used for password generation.
- `IeDATA.txt`: A text file containing an example data set for password generation.
- `passwordFile.txt`: A text file that will contain the generated passwords.
- `LICENSE`: A text file that contains the license.
- `README.md`: A text file that has the documentation.

## Usage
1. Run the `MainCode.py` script.
2. Enter the number of expressions you want to generate passwords for.
- The variable, NUMofExpress, will ultimately store the number of data pieces the user wants.
- [1] = _, [2] = _ _, [3] = _ _ _, & [4] = _ _ _ _
4. The path to the `data.txt` file containing the data is provided in advance.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the password generation process.
- If needed: use the command, 'echo -n > passwordFile.txt' (in the Shell terminal), to clear the passwords once done using the script

## Dependencies
